# Car Price Predictor

The Car Price Predictor is a web application that estimates the price of a car based on input parameters such as company, model, fuel type, year, and kilometers driven. It utilizes a machine learning model to make predictions, helping users make informed decisions when buying or selling used vehicles.

## Features

- *Company and Model Selection*: Users can choose the car's company from a list of options, and the model selection dynamically loads based on the selected company.
- *Fuel Type Specification*: Users can specify the fuel type of the vehicle.
- *Year of Purchase*: Users can provide the year of purchase to factor in depreciation.
- *Kilometers Driven*: Users can enter the number of kilometers driven, a crucial variable affecting car value.
- *Predictive Analysis*: Upon inputting the relevant details, the model predicts the estimated price of the car.

## Technologies Used

- *HTML/CSS*: Used for designing the user interface and styling.
- *JavaScript*: Utilized for implementing interactive features and handling form interactions.
- *Machine Learning Model*: The heart of the application, responsible for predicting car prices. (Note: The machine learning model is not included in the repository.)
